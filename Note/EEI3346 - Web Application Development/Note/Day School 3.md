### XML and JSON Study Notes

#### 1. XML (eXtensible Markup Language)

- **Definition:** XML is a markup language used for structuring and describing data on the web.
- **Features:**
  - Extensible set of tags, allowing for flexible data representation.
  - Content-oriented, focusing on data structure rather than presentation.
  - Supports data validation and multiple output formats.

- **Syntax:**
  - Elements structured with start tags, end tags, and data in between (e.g., `<director>Matthew Dunn</director>`).
  - Case-sensitive tags and attributes (e.g., `<City ZIP="94608">Emeryville</City>`).
  - Documents require a single root element and proper nesting of elements.

- **Document Type Definitions (DTD):**
  - Optional grammar defining the structure of XML documents.
  - Specifies allowed elements, attributes, and their relationships.

- **XML Query Languages:**
  - Used for extracting and manipulating data from XML documents.
  - Examples include XPath and XQuery, akin to SQL syntax.

#### 2. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

- **Definition:** JSON is a lightweight data interchange format derived from JavaScript.
- **Features:**
  - Language-independent and easy for both humans and machines to read.
  - Based on two structures: objects (name/value pairs) and arrays (ordered lists).

- **Data Types:**
  - Number, String, Boolean, Array, Object, and null.
  - Example: `{ "book": [ { "id": "01", "language": "Java", ... }, ... ] }`.

#### 3. XML vs JSON

- **Similarities:**
  - Used for data interchange and supported by many programming languages.

- **Differences:**
  - JSON is more lightweight and simpler for data representation.
  - XML supports namespaces, comments, and different encodings.
  - XML uses tags while JSON uses key-value pairs exclusively.

#### 4. E-commerce

- **Definition:** Buying and selling goods/services over electronic systems.
- **Significance in Business:**
  - Global reach, convenience, cost efficiency, 24/7 availability.
  - Enables digital marketing and personalized customer experiences.

- **Types of E-commerce:**
  - B2C, B2B, C2C, C2B, B2A, C2A, G2B - each targeting different market segments.

#### 5. Privacy Policy and Copyrights

- **Privacy Policy:**
  - Legal document informing users about data collection and usage.
  - Builds trust and complies with data privacy laws.

- **Copyright:**
  - Grants exclusive rights to authors/artists over their creative works.
  - Applies to website content upon publication.

- **Web Cookies:**
  - Small data pieces stored on user devices for preferences and tracking.
  - Balances personalization benefits with privacy concerns.
